Install SNOPT

Buy SNOPT source code from http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/ if you or your lab haven't buy.

Here I am using the newest version that Anne got from Stanford: SNOPT7.5

Extract SNOPT code and put it in home dictionary.

Using ./configure, make, and make install to install SNOPT in Linux. Please look at INSTALL file inside SNOPT for more detail of install.

 
Connect SNOPT with Python2.7

Download Snopt-Python code from github. You may want to download through snopt-only branch.

Set the environment variable SNOPT7LIB to the location of your SNOPT libraries, for example, the following commands assume your SNOPT Fortran libraries are in a directory called "lib" in your home directory:

```

export SNOPT7LIB=$HOME/lib

```

Looking for this web-page if you wan to learn more about set environment variable. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13428910/how-to-set-the-environmental-variable-ld-library-path-in-linux

Copy snfilewrapper.f inside snopt-python/util to snopt7/src. Add 'snfilewrapper' inside 'Submakefile' file 'SNOPT' section.

In shell, build, install, snopt-python

```

python setup.py build

python setup.py install --user

```

Run an example:

```

python dieta.py

```

Look at the closed issues for more information if you get error in installing. https://github.com/snopt/snopt-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
