# Dropping-Ball-Optimization
This project is to test the performance of Ipopt and Snopt in large scaling strong nonlinear optimization

In this project, we are trying to build the most simpliest model with strong nonlinear dynamics. One deminsional ball bouncing with ground contact model very well satisfied this requirement.

The dynamics of Ball Bouncing system is defined below:
